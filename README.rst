Technologies used and Why ?
---------------------------

To resolve this problem, we have used ``vuejs``, ``axios`` ,and ``socketIO``.

* ``vuejs``: among the best javascript web frameworks.
* ``axios``: great module to send request.
* ``socketIO``: receive socket messages from the server. It's an alternative of SSE, not correctly working with Django Backend.


Installation

Analyzing The Solution
----------------------

Before starting coding, we have to understand the problem and think of the solution. We have structured our project as follow :

* Two checkboxes to handle the create and update webhooks
* An Input File form to upload the csv files
* Forms to create, update a product, search and filter products
* Buttons for list of products and to delete products
* A Table to display the list of product

*NB :* You can see the view through the heroku link above
